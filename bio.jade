        p.desc As a freelance front end developer, graphic designer, and UX specialist, I focus on creating usable, functional, responsive websites and applications that follow industry standards and best practices and are optimized for practical development solutions. 
        p.desc I’m known for developing clean, solid, semantic markup with as little overhead and redundancy as possible—which results in lightweight, fast-loading code. And I always document code and markup so clients can easily maintain their websites. My background in graphic design allows me to hand-code pixel-perfect websites that incorporate as many aspects as possible from initial mockups.
        p.desc I believe that consistency is key when it comes to effective messaging. That’s why every website I create accurately reflects a client’s brand and voice. This also leads to higher rates of user engagement, increased call-to-action responses, and more effective overall digital branding.

        p.desc As the senior front end developer, I specialized in hand-coding custom websites while streamlining internal processes that improved efficiency and communication among team members. I introduced the practice of using Git repositories and LESS with code pre-compilers, creating consistency across the agency while allowing me to master object-oriented CSS.
